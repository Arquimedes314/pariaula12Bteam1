 # Execution
 
 the binary is called **myf** inside the build function. Thus, to run:
 
 ```bash
 ./myf
 ```

 # Compilation
 
 Create a build folder. Inside your repository's folder run
 
 ```bash
 mkdir build
 ```
 
 Now configure cmake and compile
 
 ```bash
 cd build && cmake .. && make
 ```
 
 To generate the documentation use
  
  ```bash
  make doc
  ```

 # Installation

Instructions and main packages
------------------------------
To develop and build the application, besides the GNU C/C++ compiler,
you need to have installed some packages:

  **cmake
  libgtk-3-dev
  glade**

and some documentation tools are highly advised:

**libgtk-3-doc
   gtk-3-examples
   libcairo2-doc
   devhelp
   Doxygen**

So, perform the following:

```bash
   sudo apt install cmake libgtk-3-dev libgtk-3-doc gtk-3-examples glade libcairo2-doc devhelp doxygen doxygen-gui
```

To test whether GTK was properly installed and also get acquainted with GTK
possibilities, you can use the following command to perform some testings and
verifications.

```bash
  /usr/bin/gtk3-demo

```

prototypes.h
------------

To generate the prototypes file from the proper cmake target, the following is needed:

```bash
  sudo apt install cproto exuberant-ctags indent
```

misc
----
There are other packages that can be useful for some scripts to work 
properly, but they are not necessary for this project. Follow some examples.


```bash
  sudo apt install xutils-dev graphviz imagemagick
```

asciidoc
--------
If you want to edit documents in asciidoc format, the following are
**needed/recomended**:

```bash
  sudo apt install asciidoc dblatex fop source-highlight
```

opencv
------
If you also need to use opencv, install it and its documentation:

```bash
  sudo apt install libopencv-dev opencv-doc
```

Although the documentation can be found online.
After version 3, openCV is focused on C++ and Python. So, its documentation is
oriented in those directions:

  https://docs.opencv.org/master/

However, up to that version, the documentation also incuded C language, keeping
the compatibility with the existing programs in C. So, if you use C language
for openCV, report to the last documentation version available for C, such as
version 2.4.X:

  https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/
